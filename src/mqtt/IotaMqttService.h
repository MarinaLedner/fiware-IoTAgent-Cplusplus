 @name IotaMqttService
 @brief This interface abstracts the service for interacting with the
 ContextBroker in the MQTT realm.
 In other words, this is all what MQTT protocol needs when interacting with CB,
 like publishing MQTT measures
 or receiving requests  or responses to commands. Some of those functions aren't
 offered by this service directly
 but by others referenced here.
 This class can do some basic operations with the information coming from the
 caller @see handle_mqtt_message,
 like checking if the mqtt message is a measure, a command request,or a response
 to a command.
 Based on that, it will call one of its virtual methods.
