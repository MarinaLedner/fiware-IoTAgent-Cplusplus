/*
* This class is a wrapper for controlling MQTT Broker as a separate process.
This code will work ONLY in Linux systems. We might want to implement this for
Windows
also.
The right order to call the methods is:
1. LaunchBroker, which will fork and call mosquitto broker binary.
2. WaitForBroker, a method that will execute a "wait for pid" and block the
THREAD
where it's running on. So with this, we wait for the child process to terminate,
either
successfully or abnormally (in fact, this can be whenever ports are in used or
similar
so it's not really an abnormal situation). The idea is that if mosquitto broker
can't run,
then the runner thread will just close (but this is controlled by the calling
thread).
3. Finally, stopBroker, to force the stop of the broker. This will send a
SIGTERM to the
mosquitto broker process.
